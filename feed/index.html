<p>Keeping the Residents Moving</p>
<p>Marissa Krueger can’t be deterred by age, experience, circumstances, or even by a pandemic. The wellness manager at Monarch Landing senior living community is determined to help residents live their best lives possible. She develops fitness and incentive programs that helps residents to keep up and even increase their fitness regimes despite sheltering in place.</p>
<p>Krueger, who has a Bachelor and Master of Exercise Science and Kinesiology, has worked at Monarch Landing for about a year. “I oversee the on-site fitness center, group exercise classes for independent living and all levels of care, and coordinate personal training for individuals. I also plan health chats and educational programs,” she said.</p>
<p>Krueger said that she always knew that she didn’t want to work in a corporate gym where people are working out “in order to look good in the mirror. I wanted to facilitate helping people live a better life. Working at Monarch Landing makes it easy for me to see improvements and changes in the residents’ lives. It’s more about living a good life rather than just looking good in a mirror.”</p>
<p>Monarch Landing, Krueger said, has “excellent fitness facilities including a beautiful swimming pool. Having these opportunities on site is awesome. And it’s essential that we have programs for every fitness level, from beginners to high intensity and everything in between!”</p>
<p>Krueger develops incentive programs throughout the year. Most recently, she ran what she called the Idle Ironman. “Over six weeks, participants completed the equivalent of an Ironman by running (or walking) a marathon, biking 100 miles, and swimming five miles. We had a lot of interest when the program started, and then when residents started sheltering within their apartments, it became more difficult. People started using portable pedal bikes for the biking part and walked around the building. Because the pool was closed, we let participants switch out the swimming portion with extra walking. Three people completed the entire program while in quarantine. They all got Idle Ironman t-shirts.” Krueger added that the best outcome of the program was that a participating resident told her it really helped her deal with the quarantine. “Since she was in her apartment all the time, she said it gave her motivation and kept her going during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>Aside from incentive programs during sheltering in place, Krueger is keeping residents active through exercise videos that are streamed through the in-house television to the residents’ apartments several times a day. “We have different ability levels and include seated and standing exercise and balance classes,” she said. “I also coordinate a lot of in-home programs. I talk to the residents and see what they want and need, and then put together a hand-out with descriptions of a fitness regime just for them.”</p>
<p>Krueger said that people who would not typically be exercising are participating and, in fact, enjoying the videos within their apartments. “I think it’s partly because there are fewer activities going on now, so there’s less of an excuse not to exercise. Additionally, people who perhaps have mobility or vision issues are more comfortable working out within their apartments. Our plan is to continue to run fitness videos on the in-house television even when our regular fitness schedule begins again because it’s been so successful in reaching a new group of people.”</p>
<p>Most recently, Krueger set up an outdoor fitness circuit. With the warmer weather and the campus’s beautiful grounds, residents and even staff are enjoying the opportunity to exercise outside while maintaining social distancing. “There are eight fitness stations around the perimeter of the campus. They don’t require any equipment. It’s a different exercise at each station. A resident whose window overlooks one of the stations told me that he sees people working out all day long,” she said.</p>
<p>Krueger said that her favorite part of her job working with seniors is hearing positive stories about how well the residents are doing and feeling. “It doesn’t take an enormous amount of effort before they start seeing a big difference in their wellness, strength, and balance. It’s rewarding to me and rewarding to them to be able to live a fuller life being more active and independent,” she said.</p>
<p>Krueger cited one of her favorite testimonials. A gentleman who recently turned 90 told her that he’d never had the time or opportunity to work out before he retired. Now, with the fitness center on-site and instruction and assistance available, he’s exercising regularly. “He told me he’s in the best shape of his life. It’s so rewarding!”</p>

There’s nothing like a good book. Whatever one’s taste or type, a great read can do so much: take us on great adventures, introduce us to new people and places, entertain, inform, inspire, soothe, <a href="https://seniorslifestylemag.com/health-well-being/benefits-of-reading-for-seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boost physical, cognitive and emotional health</a>…the list goes on.</p>
<p>Reading, whether from a paper book or an e-device, can be accomplished most anywhere. But there’s something special about <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/10-quotes-about-libraries-because-theyre-truly-the-most-magical-places-on-earth-73284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the place where books live</a> – the hushed, hallowed hallways of a library.</p>
<p>As houses of worship signify religion and spirituality, libraries symbolize learning and a quest for knowledge. Almost as early as humans began to express themselves in written or drawn form, libraries of one sort or another came into being. Today, there are nearly 117,000 in the U.S.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC314099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history of libraries</a> is so vast and comprehensive, it’s actually an academic discipline. But suffice it to say that the storage of writings and records goes back roughly 5,000 years, according to archeologists who have unearthed thousands of clay tablets in ancient temples.</p>
<p>Advancements throughout the ages have paved the way for libraries as we know them today, with technology rendering even relatively contemporary practices like the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2011-02-18-ct-met-drop-dewey-20110218-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dewey Decimal System</a> nearly obsolete. Young people gawk at their parents’ and grandparents’ stories of trudging to the library to gather research for a school paper or project. <em>Microfilm? Microfiche? What?</em></p>
<p>Indeed, with the Internet at our fingertips, we scarcely need to step foot into a library (which, in the current climate of social distancing and sheltering in place, is probably a good thing).</p>
<p>Yet, despite the self-contained vacuum in which we can function day to day, the physical space of a library remains uniquely appealing.</p>
<p>Says library scientist Frieda Weise, “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC314099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Libraries provide a constant to people</a> in a time when change occurs too rapidly to cope with and there is fear of losing historical consciousness.” Perhaps so, but let’s bring it down to earth a bit.</p>
<p>Depending on size, style and age, libraries can summon feelings and stir the senses. Old, cavernous libraries whisper of bygone scholars, their shelves of old tomes smelling of weathered paper and leather. Small libraries with cozy nooks (including those in homes and communities like Monarch Landing) comfort and soothe. Modern libraries with sleek furnishings and generous light excite us with the possibilities of the future.</p>
<p>Naperville’s public library system, consisting of three branches, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2010-04-28-chi-library-100428-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranks consistently as one of the best</a> in the country. Napervillians are such avid readers, one can wait weeks for a book to go off hold.</p>
<p>Monarch Landing’s <a href="https://patch.com/illinois/plainfield/monarch-landing-brings-public-library-experience-home_efe2ebb6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully automated, extensive library</a> is a resident-driven public library experience brought home. Residents’ thirst for lifelong learning is the driving force behind its growth and community-wide appeal.</p>
<p>As many libraries across the country and world are temporarily closed to the public, Monarch Landing’s was unusually quiet as well. But, cautiously, with all safety measures in place, the popular spot is reopening to “booming business.”</p>
<p>We think that’s something to shout about!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 12, 2020</p>
<p>Federal and state governments are releasing plans to reopen the economy to essential business. While this is an encouraging sign to our country’s response to COVID-19, please know this process will be taken thoughtfully at Monarch Landing. We will implement a three-phased approach when reopening our community. Decisions for each phase will be based on state and regional criteria, advice from public health officials, and the health status of our community.</p>
<p>We are all looking forward to the day when we can resume our lives as a community and gather with our friends, yet the health and safety of our residents and employees must remain our highest priority. From the beginning, we have taken on this challenge as a marathon rather than a sprint. There are no short cuts or easy answers to how we reduce our risk to COVID-19 and it’s as important as ever that we continue to remain focused on protecting ourselves and supporting each other.</p>
<p>In the upcoming weeks, and until further notice, Monarch Landing will continue to follow the heightened precautionary measures currently in place. These practices include following social distancing protocol and restricting non-essential visitors. We understand the risks posed to our community from COVID-19 and remain committed to our processes. We’ll only begin to shift our protocols after we know our community is no longer at risk, and with careful consideration of the guidance offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and local and state health departments. As the situation develops, and we make changes to our protocols, residents, employees and families will be notified first —but to reiterate, we will not be modifying our precautionary measures at this time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience, your support, and for embodying that hopeful spirit that Monarch Landing is known for as we continue to navigate this process together. For more information about COVID-19 and our response to COVID-19, go to <a href="https://www.lcsnet.com/covid-19-update/">https://www.lcsnet.com/covid-19-update/</a>.</p>

It’s not unusual for Professor Peter Sorensen to see a few of his former students at Monarch Landing senior living community. Now fellow residents, they nod hello from safe social distances.</p>
<p>He sees his current students on a video conference screen because, for the time being, in-class instruction is not possible.</p>
<p>The distinguished and multi-awarded scholar is chair and a founder of the master’s and PhD program in Organization Development at Benedictine University in Lisle. This is the institution’s first doctoral program and, in fact, the first on that level at any Benedictine college or university. It is also one of the earliest in the field.</p>
<p>When his students from across the U.S. were physically attending classes, Peter made the 15-minute drive to work from the retirement community into which he and his wife Nancy moved five years ago. Now, Monarch Landing is not only his home, but also his workplace.</p>
<p>However, he is anything but retired. On the contrary, he spends 70 hours a week immersed in at-home university life, preparing, instructing and “learning all the things that can go wrong with a computer,” he quips.</p>
<p>“Overall, I am extremely lucky. Each day, I get to chat with some of the most accomplished and contributing people in the field and with students who are, or soon will be, making their own contribution,” said Peter. “Everything has changed, yet nothing has changed,” he added of the shift from teaching onsite to teaching online.</p>
<p>Focused primarily on strategic management and international organization change and development, the program Peter helped pioneer at Benedictine has produced executives and consultants with major global corporations.</p>
<p>“We are making plans for alternative futures,” he said, noting that during the 2008 economic crisis, a number of Benedictine scholars’ research projects and dissertations dealt with the success or failure of corporations’ response to the changes. Today’s climate will most certainly inspire similar studies.</p>
<p>While much of his time is devoted to academia, Peter enjoys life at the Naperville community he and Nancy chose as “part of their preparation for the future,” he said. His praise of staff at Monarch Landing is second perhaps only to praise of his wife.</p>
<p>A former assistant director at CNA Financial, Peter met Nancy when she was hired there. “I met a very special person. That was over 50 years ago, and Nancy is still that very special person,” said the man who earned his PhD on a GI bill after serving in the Army.</p>
<p>Monarch Landing’s staff members top the list of Peter and Nancy’s reasons for loving life at the picturesque community near acres of native prairieland and convenient crossroads. “They are just fantastic! How do they all remember your name and who you are?” he ponders.</p>
<p>“During these times you have a chance to reflect. And you begin to realize how you really care. If you don’t see [members of the staff], you start to worry. And then you see them again and everything is all right,” said Peter.</p>
<p>“And you get the impression that the feeling is mutual. We really think it is.”</p>

Many mothers want nothing more for Mother’s Day than quality time with their children, grandchildren and family. But this year, that “gift” presents particular challenges as we shelter in place and keep our safe social distances.</p>
<p>However, just as senior living communities like Monarch Landing are finding innovative ways to help residents stay connected and engaged, families can still <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/7794559/how-celebrate-mothers-day-during-social-distancing-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keep Mom close</a> on her special day.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/7794559/how-celebrate-mothers-day-during-social-distancing-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ways to celebrate all the mothers in our lives</a> this May 10<sup>th.</sup></p>
<p><strong>Have a virtual Mother’s Day brunch</strong>. Whether we like it or not, video conferencing with co-workers, friends and family has quickly become a way of life. On Mother’s Day, families can plan a special online meal, whereby each person contributes part of the culinary array (and shows it off!) or everyone makes the same meal and enjoys it together. Note: to avoid technical headaches, make sure  you have adequate <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-video-conferencing-software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video conferencing software</a> and Mom understands how to log in <em>before</em> your virtual celebration!</p>
<p><strong>Arrange for a meal to be delivered from her favorite restaurant. </strong>Mother’s Day is the <a href="https://www.fsrmagazine.com/marketing-promotions/dollar-days" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular day of the year for dining out</a>. While that will not be happening this Mother’s Day, there are many restaurants that will cater to Mom right at her front door. Popular <a href="https://downtownnaperville.com/dine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mother’s Day brunch destinations</a> in Naperville offer curbside and delivery services, some free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>Send her a “goody bag” or gift basket of special things</strong> <strong>for now and later</strong>. Everyone is looking forward to doing our favorite things again, and Mom is no exception. Surprise her with a gift card to a favorite local restaurant, hair salon, clothing store, spa, etc. She’ll have something to look forward to and think of you when the time comes to enjoy. Until then, include sweet treats, puzzles, a photo album of favorite snapshots, a poem written especially for her, flower seeds, a hand-made mask…the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p><strong>Take a virtual walk down memory lane. </strong>Add a little nostalgia to your virtual celebration by sharing photos of you with Mom, her grandchildren, at special occasions, on vacation, etc. This will keep great memories alive and inspire dreams of the next in-person memories to be made.</p>
<p><strong>Make lemonade – literally! </strong>There has never been a more appropriate time to “make lemonade when life gives you lemons,” as we adjust to our new normal and make the best of a difficult situation. As luck (or perhaps irony) would have it, May 3 is <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/lemonade-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Lemonade Day</a>. How about putting a little zest in Mother’s Day by sending your mom a good <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-lemonade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lemonade recipe</a> (and perhaps the ingredients too)? Then, enjoy a sip together at your virtual celebration!</p>
<p><strong>Your family is our family</strong>. At Monarch Landing, many of our residents are mothers, grandmothers and even great-grandmothers. We know they are missing face-to-face visits with their families, especially during times of celebration.</p>
<p>We are a family too, and we are helping our Monarch Landing community stay in frequent touch with their loved ones and one another – all at safe social distances and with the help of our in-house TV station, virtual technology, and novel thinking.</p>
<p>We are also serving up some wonderful Mother’s Day fare – and fanfare! – to delight and pamper our special residents of honor.</p>
<p>Most of all, we are holding fast to the hope that soon enough, we will be able to give our mothers and all the special people in our lives a great big hug!</p>

<p>It’s not every day that a person turns 90, and it had been an event for which Lois Selzer’s family had been planning for many months. The former Des Plaines resident had moved to Monarch Landing senior living community three years ago and has enjoyed the friendly atmosphere, and the many activities and amenities. Last week she learned firsthand about the creativity and dedication of the staff, her fellow residents, and family members. Challenged, but not dismayed, the people who love Lois made sure she still had a birthday celebration worth remembering.</p>
<p>“We were very concerned about not having a traditional birthday party for mom/grandma, especially in light of it being her 90th. We were so looking forward to getting together for such a special celebration in her honor,” said Robin Schultz, Lois’s daughter. “When the ‘stay at home’ order was placed, and we knew we couldn’t have a party or see her in person, it was very disappointing and heartbreaking. We were sad thinking about her spending her birthday alone.”</p>
<p>The family chatted with each other and staff at Monarch Landing, hatching ideas for making the big day as memorable as possible for Lois. Everyone was on board. “We can’t even describe how wonderful things turned out,” said Robin. “Mom was showered with phone calls, cards, notes, and surprise gifts from so many people. It was absolutely amazing. When I spoke with her over the phone, I could hear the joy in her voice. Despite the circumstances, she said she had one of the best birthdays ever. We can’t begin to thank everyone for helping make that happen. We will, of course, have the family celebration at a later date, but having her day turn out the way it did was unbelievably heartwarming!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the midst of these challenging times, there’s something to celebrate – the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Earth Day on April 22. And if silver linings are your thing, there is reliable evidence that the current health pandemic is <a href="https://eponline.com/articles/2020/03/24/covid19-and-climate-change-the-unexpected-pairing.aspx?m=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefiting the environment</a>, and rather quickly, too.</p>
<p>Indeed, reduced vehicular traffic and airplane travel is doing Mother Earth a big favor. As much of life has slowed, so has the world’s output of <a href="https://eponline.com/articles/2020/03/24/covid19-and-climate-change-the-unexpected-pairing.aspx?m=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greenhouse gases</a>.</p>
<p>According to China&#8217;s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, data recorded over the first three months of 2020 shows an 84.5 percent <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/covid-19-and-nature-trade-paradigm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase in days with good air quality</a> in over 300 cities. Satellite data from NASA shows a decline in nitrogen dioxide over China. And, for the first time in 30 years, the Dhauladhar <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/jalandhar-residents-wake-up-to-view-of-himalayan-range-as-covid-19-lockdown-leaves-air-cleaner-2563427.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mountain range is visible</a> to residents of Jalandhar, India.</p>
<p>While few could have predicted our current landscape, much less welcomed it, it’s certainly promising that a precious piece of good news aligns with the semicentennial of Earth Day. Since the <a href="https://www.earthday.org/history/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwybD0BRDyARIsACyS8msSv2_UkXCAxzE67d3sF4eGidLrepLp-gOOpP2ipIlyE1TzvnENysQaAlUEEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first Earth Day</a> on April 22, 1970, 1 billion people in over 190 countries across the world have sprung into action on behalf of our gorgeous blue planet.</p>
<p>This year, many organized Earth Day activities, like <a href="https://www.napervilleparks.org/earthweek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naperville’s Earth Week</a>, have been postponed until a later date. Other efforts are <a href="https://earthrise2020.org/?source=ads_earthday-nat&amp;utm_medium=om&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=g-lb-earthday2020-search&amp;utm_content=g-lb-earthday2020-search_earthday-nat_earthdayc2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwybD0BRDyARIsACyS8muL64AIhuYOWNxgzb1j0yYLJZlG9ZMrHl9uJ4829lIqqYW8mpaPU3EaApknEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobilizing online</a>. But, given Earth Day’s emphasis on nature and the great outdoors, there are still many ways we can <a href="https://www.allianceforthebay.org/2020/03/how-to-celebrate-earth-day-while-staying-home-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">observe and celebrate</a> this special day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go outside! </strong>Flora and fauna are blossoming and frolicking, blithely unaware of anything but the reawakening of the earth after a long winter. Even if it’s just opening your window or stepping onto your porch or balcony, enjoy the budding trees and flowers, warming air, and all creatures great and small flitting and scurrying about. Here at Monarch Landing, our beautiful, <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/2019/07/02/resident-gardens-to-protect-monarchs-and-other-pollinators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resident-maintained gardens</a> and surrounding 60 acres of native prairie plants are exquisite, especially in the springtime.</li>
<li><strong>Get your hands in the dirt. </strong>Planting a flower bed or even a small pot can be both <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/03/health/sw-horticultural-therapy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physically and emotionally therapeutic</a>. Just ask our many Monarch Landing residents for whom gardening is life!</li>
<li><strong>Take a walk. </strong>It is considered <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-questions-answered-can-i-walk-outside-is-the-virus-on-my-shoes-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">safe and beneficial to walk outside</a>, as long as proper social distancing is practiced. Even a short stroll is refreshing and invigorating, not to mention liberating! Monarch Landing’s walking/bike paths are just begging to be explored as spring explodes around us. The <a href="https://www.visitnaperville.com/naperville-parks-and-recreation/riverwalk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naperville Riverwalk</a> and <a href="https://www.dupageco.org/EDP/Bikeways_and_Trails/1150/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuPage County’s prairie path</a> system offer delightful walking experiences as well.</li>
<li><strong>Practice responsible recycling/repurposing. </strong>Literally a <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/2019/09/24/helping-monarchs-one-butterfly-at-a-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haven for butterflies</a> and other creatures that <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/2019/09/23/bees-butterflies-and-our-beautiful-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefit ecology</a>, Monarch Landing also offers residents <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/2019/12/17/everything-old-is-new-and-useful-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-stream recycling</a> and fun shopping opportunities at our Treasure Chest resale shop.</li>
<li><strong>Study up on Earth Day. </strong>The history, motivation and inspiration surrounding Earth Day make for very interesting reading as we shelter in place. <a href="https://www.earthday.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwybD0BRDyARIsACyS8ms26Ub5m9voXi0FRS4B2UojlCorm5RyU022DS-9N53N-FV6f6aaPX4aAqApEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a> and discover how you might get involved as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>This April 22, when Earth Day turns 50 in the face of an unprecedented global situation, let’s celebrate the good growing all around us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every day, I am grateful I&#8217;m here,&#8221; said Kate Carmichael, a resident of Monarch Landing senior living community in Naperville.</p>
<p>Older adults who are not living within the secure environment of a retirement community are having to navigate crowded grocery stores and miss out on activities and social connectivity. Kate said that she feels safe, cared for, and engaged within her apartment at Monarch Landing.</p>
<p>In addition to having meals prepared and delivered to her door, Kate said that the staff at Monarch Landing has partnered with a local store to have grocery and household items delivered. &#8220;Residents don&#8217;t have to go out at all. Frankly, I&#8217;m relieved that I don&#8217;t need to leave. The fewer people out anywhere, the better. Another reason we&#8217;re glad we don&#8217;t own a home anymore is if something went wrong with an appliance or with the plumbing, it would be difficult to get service. Here, we just put in a maintenance request to General Services.”</p>
<p>The lifestyles team at Monarch Landing is making sure that the residents&#8217; activities calendars remain robust. &#8220;Marissa Krueger, our wellness manager, has posted videos of her fitness classes on Touchtown, our resident internet portal, and on our in-house TV station, which is broadcast to our apartments.&#8221; Other daily opportunities include comedy or musical entertainment, brain games, TED Talks, educational programming, and more.</p>
<p>A self-professed techy, Kate is also enjoying virtual experiences that Sherry DeFillippo, lifestyle manager, has shared with residents. &#8220;There are fun links to adventures like the Atlanta Zoo&#8217;s live panda cam, and YouTube videos like flying over Norway,&#8221; said Kate. She can virtually travel the world, tour museums and historical sites, watch Broadway shows, and enjoy concerts, all from the comfort of her apartment.</p>
<p>Kate said that a group of residents of Monarch Landing have traditionally eaten together whenever meatloaf appears as one of the options on the dining menu. With meatloaf being offered this weekend, Kate has learned how to use ZOOM video conferencing tool in order for the friends to be able to virtually dine together. “We talk regularly on the phone, but this allows us to see each other too,” she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must say that technology has made sheltering in place a whole lot more pleasant. I&#8217;m never bored. The days go by just as quickly as they did when I was out and about,” she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say enough good things about our staff. They are fantastic and have really been ahead of the curve. They started instituting measures towards social distancing weeks ago. All of us are safe, well-fed, and kept well informed during this unprecedented time,&#8221; Kate concluded.</p>

<p>“A day without laughter is a day wasted,” said Charlie Chaplin. According to Laura Ingalls Wilder, “A good laugh overcomes more difficulties and dissipates more dark clouds than any other one thing.”</p>
<p>The power of laughter is mighty indeed. Psychologists tell us a sense of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/arts-and-health/200806/humor-the-human-gift-coping-and-survival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">humor is necessary to help us cope</a> and even survive. Especially in times of challenge.</p>
<p>April Fool’s Day, associated with laughter, levity and maybe a little mischief, is one of <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/april-fools-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">questionable origin</a>. Equally uncertain among great thinkers is why humans laugh or have a sense of humor in the first place. Let’s explore some of their <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/out-the-ooze/201804/your-sense-humor-can-serve-social-radar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposals</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Laugh?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Taboo instincts</em>. Sigmund Freud, the groundbreaking Austrian neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis, believed that humor serves as an outlet for forbidden impulses.</li>
<li><em>Above it all</em>. Philosophers Aristotle and Descartes believed that amusement and laughter are humans’ response to feeling superior to another.</li>
<li><em>Surprised by the unexpected</em>. Psychologists A. Peter McGraw and Caleb Warren suggested that the funny bone is tickled when people expect one outcome, and another one happens instead. A violation of social norms can be humorous as long as it doesn’t cross the boundaries of safety or morality.</li>
<li><em>Risk, reward</em>. A more recent idea posits that humor evolved as a sort of reward after the difficult process of culling out who is or is not to be trusted. Once concerns about another’s intentions are debunked, we are awarded a light, pleasant experience.</li>
<li><em>It’s all about sex</em>. Evolutionary scientists believed that humor is a function of sexual selection, whereby an amusing person is considered more intelligent and more attractive to the opposite sex. In this line of reasoning, a sense of humor is essential to the survival of humanity. (Interestingly, men want their partners to think they’re funny, while women want someone who will make them laugh.)</li>
<li><em>Social radar</em>. Social psychologist Frank T. McAndrew may have struck the right chord by proposing that a sense of humor is a tool to identify like-minded comrades in a group of strangers. Aren’t we all just a little relieved when someone cracks a joke in an awkward situation?</li>
</ul>
<p>The reasons humans (and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/60864-do-animals-have-humor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even some animals</a>) have a sense of humor are perhaps up for debate, but the fact that we need to laugh is undeniable.</p>
<p>Research shores up the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relief/art-20044456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many benefits of laughter</a>. A good guffaw releases happy hormones, strengthens the immune system, stimulates the lungs, heart and muscles, reduces stress levels, increases the relaxation response, and relieves chronic pain. <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/humor-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humor therapy</a> is invaluable in treating disease, proving that laughter really is the best medicine.</p>
<p>At Monarch Landing, we celebrate humor and levity, particularly in these trying times. We have always emphasized fun in every aspect, from friendships to fellowship, food and <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/2018/03/29/fitness-laughing-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fitness</a>.</p>
<p>Through our own in-house television station, we’re bringing that same spirit of laughter and fun to residents in their apartments, keeping them engaged and entertained with our <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/2020/03/27/full-calendars-despite-social-distancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full calendar of daily programs and activities</a>. As a community, we’re virtually sharing the many <a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/entertainment/2020/03/27/coronavirus-blues-these-memes-tweets-will-brighten-your-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memes and videos</a> that tastefully brighten the current mood.</p>
<p>Even as we practice safe social distancing, we’re staying closer than ever in the joy of laughter that will surely get us through.</p>

<p>Their hallways and common areas may be empty, but their activity calendars certainly are not. Per the guidelines of social distancing in order to maintain good health for themselves and others, residents of Monarch Landing senior living community are remaining within their apartments. Rather than residents going to the community’s many activities and events, those programs are being brought to them through Monarch Landing’s in-house television station.</p>
<p>Sherry DeFillippo, lifestyle manager at the retirement community, said that her team is taping, streaming, and broadcasting activities, filling up each daily schedule with programming including mindfulness, exercise, educational shows, brain games, and comedy/musical entertainment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has also loaded virtual experiences and travel experiences on to their portal for the residents to enjoy.</p>
<p>“Staying active and engaged is such an integral part of Monarch Landing. Right now, it’s a little bit more of a challenge, providing opportunities to the residents, but our team is creative and enthusiastic and dedicated to keeping the residents busy,” said Sherry.</p>
