<p>The city of Naperville is known as one of the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/naperville-sun/ct-nvs-niche-rankings-naperville-st-0306-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best places in America to live</a>. It is also known for its <a href="https://patch.com/illinois/naperville/naperville-public-library-rated-one-of-the-best-in-nation-6-years-running" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world-class library</a> system and, in one arguably ridiculous listing, one of <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/?s=beach+town" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s top beach towns</a>. What started as a small farm town established in the mid-1800s has become a thriving city of nearly 150,000 people. Joe Naper’s settlement has come a long way.</p>
<p>Naperville may also soon be considered an entertainment epicenter (which isn’t nearly as implausible as its beach town designation). That’s because a huge expanse of land that already houses Topgolf and WhirlyBall at the northwest corner of Route 59 and I-88, within a stone’s throw of Monarch Landing, is destined to become a tourist attraction in its own right.</p>
<p>“Live, work, play, stay” is the concept of the so-named <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20200112/citygate-plans-to-bring-entertainment-destinations-to-naperville?fbclid=IwAR2PItITC9E628Cyxxn2URTUnuJrU2cAOeh0ThK4x6IrpSNnC6Sp6kKllf8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CityGate Centre</a>, slated to include an apartment building with a rooftop event center, an arena for hockey games, concerts and conventions, and a brewery or winery with a restaurant and hotel – all within a backdrop of public art.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Naperville is home to but one <a href="https://www.harrisonhousebb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bed and breakfast</a> and one <a href="https://www.ihg.com/hotelindigo/hotels/us/en/naperville/chins/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-IN-_-US-_-CHINS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotel</a> in the downtown area, it hasn’t always been top on the list of vacation destinations. However, if Mayor Steve Chirico and CityGate Centre developers have their way, that may all change.</p>
<p>As it stands now, Naperville has delighted many a visitor and resident with its <a href="https://downtownnaperville.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vibrant downtown</a>, featuring upscale restaurants and shops, the lovely <a href="https://www.napervilleparks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riverwalk</a>, the chic <a href="https://www.waterstreetnaperville.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Street district</a>, and the historic <a href="https://napersettlement.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA04XxBRD5ARIsAGFygj9TvBdGFCK9Fqqh7xsF8G5-zpVEeDcDzJCfLfxLMMoXzIPW2lozkhwaAqx9EALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naper Settlement</a>. Charming little <a href="https://tuktuknaperville.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuk Tuks</a> tote fun-seekers around from one spot to the next, and the <a href="https://napervilletrolley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naperville Trolley</a> is always a sign of a festive time.</p>
<p>Why do people seek entertainment? Psychologists posit that, as the highest form of life on earth, humans have built-in neural processes that predispose us to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-drugs-and-boredom/200908/why-is-entertainment-so-entertaining" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value narratives</a> – whether the simple oral tales that circulated long ago or the grand (and wickedly expensive) stage productions of today. What makes narratives so attractive is our unique ability to grasp imitation, to insert ourselves in stories and understand what someone else is experiencing.</p>
<p>But we must be careful. The most ubiquitous form of narrative entertainment – television – is a passive form that, in excess, is <a href="https://www.livescience.com/52959-television-cognitive-function.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not healthy for the brain</a> and inhibits meaningful social interactions. Yet, the average American watches nearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four hours of TV</a> per day, and people over 65 watch <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/older-adults-watch-most-tv-report-2214116/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over seven hours a day</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, active forms of entertainment are enormously beneficial, and seniors stand to gain much from inserting themselves in the scene. Inactivity, especially in older age, can contribute to cancer, osteoporosis, depression, diabetes, hypertension, dementia, and a host of other ailments. Active seniors, however, experience improved stamina, mobility, strength, cognitive function, socialization, and overall health and well-being.</p>
<p>At Monarch Landing, across the street from the developing CityGate Centre, a multitude of clubs and committees, programs and activities, fitness offerings, cultural outings, nature expeditions and so much more engage residents daily. Opportunities for healthy entertainment and vital interactions with others are virtually endless.</p>
<p>One might even say that Monarch Landing itself is a vacation destination!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27873" src="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/relax.jpg" alt="Seniors relaxing" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/welcometomonarchlanding-prod-assets/uploads/2019/04/relax.jpg 1000w, https://storage.googleapis.com/welcometomonarchlanding-prod-assets/uploads/2019/04/relax-300x200.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/welcometomonarchlanding-prod-assets/uploads/2019/04/relax-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Mid-April can be a beautiful time of year in the Midwest, with crocuses and tulips pushing their way through the soil and trees donning the first fuzz of blossoms to come. It can also be a time of wildly unpredictable weather, as displayed by the recent all-day snow we had around these parts. Photos of new spring bulbs withered and covered in snow were popping up all over social media.</p>
<p>One thing that can always be counted on in the middle of April, however, is tax day. While tax paying changes for seniors, depending on several factors, life in general can be taxing for many of them. In the U.S., 29 percent of <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/geriatrics/social-issues-in-the-elderly/the-elderly-living-alone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seniors live alone</a>. Among that percentage, many older adults experience isolation, inactivity and increasingly difficult home and personal care.</p>
<p>While many seniors want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, the <a href="https://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/why-seniors-prefer-senior-living-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of community senior living</a> are undeniable: new friends and social connections; a daily smorgasbord of activities and opportunities to develop new hobbies; safe transportation to errands and outings; sumptuous, nutritious fare created by professional chefs in upscale dining spaces; safe, secure surroundings; multiple fun, fresh fitness options for all ability levels; manageable, well-appointed apartments; freedom from housekeeping, yard maintenance and other mundane duties; personal care and attention onsite, if needed; beautiful interior and exterior environs; and freedom to enjoy life to its fullest – finally.</p>
<p>Countless residents of today’s senior campuses wish they’d moved in long before they actually did. Gone are the days of sterile, depressing “nursing homes”; here are the days of resort-like living that allows seniors <a href="https://www.aging.com/independent-living-is-the-top-choice-for-seniors-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more independence and freedom</a> than they’ve ever known.</p>
<p>A day in the life of a senior in his or her own home might include decreased or no transportation to errands or social activities, decreased ability to shop for and prepare tasty, nutritious meals, decreased ability to care for home, yard and self, compromised mobility, and feelings of loneliness and boredom.</p>
<p>Now, consider this: “I can’t reach my mother; she’s constantly busy with activities and outings,” said the daughter of a Monarch Landing resident. This is a real “complaint” heard often from adult children of our residents.</p>
<p>That’s because at Monarch Landing, onsite healthcare for all stages of residents’ lives is just one of the promises we keep. Understanding that quality of life is a <a href="https://www.lifecareservices-seniorliving.com/8-dimensions-wellness-can-enhance-seniors-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holistic mesh</a> of physical, emotional, spiritual, social, vocational, intellectual, and environmental wellness, we are committed to ensuring that residents’ decision to move into senior living is one they’ll cherish.</p>
<p>Consistently ranked one of the <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/naperville-dupage-il/rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best places to live in America</a>, Naperville provides residents a broader backdrop of life abuzz with intrigue and interest. Whether it’s fine dining, shopping, nightlife, arts and entertainment, nature trails, festivals, <a href="https://www.napersettlement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naper Settlement</a>, the iconic <a href="https://www.naperville.il.us/enjoy-naperville/naperville-riverwalk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riverwalk</a>, <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/2017/08/18/lifes-beach-town-nowhere-near-shore/">the beach</a>, top-rated libraries and more, this city lacks for nothing in the way of engaging activity for seniors, their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Tax season is a stressful time indeed. But for people in senior housing, life is anything but taxing.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Naperville is all over the map these days. This summer, we learned that our fair city is among America&rsquo;s top &ldquo;beach towns,&rdquo; albeit no shore in sight. Now, a popular show on Netflix, <em>Ozark</em>, features a fictitious family (thankfully, given the drama&rsquo;s focus on drug money laundering) from &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; Naperville. To add extra intrigue to our suburban milieu, one of the show&rsquo;s characters dubs it &ldquo;Naperthrill.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With 58 people from Naperville listed by Wikipedia as &ldquo;famous,&rdquo; perhaps we don&rsquo;t need a television show to shine a light on our town. Among them are award-winning poet and novelist Luis Alberto Urrea, actors Paul Brittain (<em>Saturday Night Live</em>), David Eigenberg (<em>Sex and the City</em>) and Bob Odenkirk (<em>Breaking Bad; Better Call Saul</em>), <em>American Idol</em> finalist Gina Glocksen, TV personality Paula Zahn, New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton, Olympic figure skater Evan Lysacek, and basketball stars Antonio Davis, Anthony Parker, and Candace Parker. And a long-standing rumor that Oprah Winfrey bought a home in &ldquo;horse country&rdquo; on Hobson Road in Naperville still persists.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Monarch Landing itself has some residents with local celebrity and considerable influence. By now, most citizens are aware of, have perhaps even participated in, the Naperville Area CROP Walk. On October 15, this community effort to end world hunger will celebrate its 35<sup>th</sup> year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But it was United Methodist pastor and Monarch Landing resident Duane Mevis who helped the CROP Walk take its very first steps. A founder of the annual Sunday stroll that has now raised well over a million dollars in the fight against hunger, Duane is still actively involved in the CROP Walk, as are several of his fellow Monarch Landing residents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Duane is also one of the founders of the Fox Valley Habitat for Humanity affiliate, which has been building homes for qualified families in the Fox Valley area since 1989. What a humanitarian rock star!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another Monarch Landing resident, John Baber, takes a real-life page from the <em>X-Files</em>, having started a career with the FBI at the age of just 18. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend to be an agent for all my life,&rdquo; said the retired Assistant Special Agent in Charge of Chicago in a <em>Daily Herald</em> feature a few years back. &ldquo;It just seemed like a challenge to figure out what a criminal was doing in terms of embezzlement or fraud. That was fun for me.&rdquo; Fun for him, good for justice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Monarch Landing resident Merrill Litchfield is a real-life hero like those in the <em>Backdraft </em>movies about the perils and valor of being a firefighter. A 31-year veteran of the Naperville Fire Department, Merrill dreamed of this profession from the time he was a young boy, witnessing the courage of volunteer firefighters in his boyhood town of Fremont, Indiana. A trained paramedic too, Merrill saw his share of life-and-death situations and often put his own life on the line to save others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Famous citizens, quasi-beach town status, number one-ranked town in America&hellip;&rdquo;Naperthrill&rdquo; has certainly earned a national name for itself. But, as any real Naperville resident knows, it could fly completely under the radar all the time and still be the best place to live, anywhere, any day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-26971 aligncenter" src="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Beach-2.jpg" alt="Beach Photo" /></p>
<p>Monarch Landing residents may be surprised and amused (as was Naperville Mayor Steve Chirico) to learn that Naperville is one of America’s top “beach towns.” Yep, you read that right. Fake news? Nope.</p>
<p>In late June, <a target="_blank" href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-beach-towns-to-live-in/36567/">WalletHub</a> released a list of the top beach towns in the U.S., and land-locked Naperville made the list at number 30 out of 50. It placed higher than Santa Monica, CA, Destin, FL, and almost everywhere in Hawaii. (Incidentally, the Illinois cities of Highland Park – on the real beach shores of Lake Michigan – and Batavia ranked numbers 38 and 47, respectively.)</p>
<p>Despite the laughable improbability of Naperville being considered a beach town, it is, in fact, a town with a beach. Take a stroll along the <a href="https://www.naperville.il.us/enjoy-naperville/naperville-riverwalk/" target="_blank">Naperville Riverwalk</a>, and you’ll see it there along Jackson Avenue: <a href="https://www.centennialbeach.org/" target="_blank">Centennial Beach</a>, with its imported sand, cement “shores” and jadish, chlorinated waters. No salty air or wind-swept dunes announce its presence, but the sound of splashing and frolicking swimmers wafts on the summer breeze just the same.</p>
<p>Including such criteria as affordability, weather, safety, economy, education, health and quality of life, as well as populations between 10,000 and 150,000, WalletHub’s beach town list gave Naperville a nebulous score of 59.73. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g36422-d1441373-Reviews-Centennial_Beach-Naperville_Illinois.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a> ranked Centennial Beach highly as well. “<a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20170628/CRED0701/170629843/this-suburb-is-one-of-nations-best-beach-towns" target="_blank">It’s hysterical</a> that Naperville ended up on a list with scenic beach towns like Key West, Florida,” said Chirico, who spent his childhood summers at Centennial Beach.</p>
<p>Technically, <a href="https://www.centennialbeach.org/history" target="_blank">Centennial Beach is a quarry</a>, used between 1833 and 1913 as a source of limestone, the mineral used in many of the foundations of early Naperville buildings and in much of its architecture still today.</p>
<p>In 1931, the year of Naperville’s 100<sup>th</sup> birthday, a committee dedicated to the city’s centennial oversaw the acquisition and development of the quarry land for a total donation of $16,500. Development of a swimming facility on the site began in 1932, and Centennial Beach opened later that year.</p>
<p>Admission was free at first, then increased to 10 cents for children, 35 cents for adults and 50 cents on holidays, bringing in $6,000 in revenue during the Beach’s first year. When the <a href="https://www.napervilleparks.org/" target="_blank">Naperville Park District</a> assumed responsibility for the Beach from the city in 1969, plans were made to limit it to only boating and fishing.</p>
<p>Thus ensued a successful “Save the Beach” campaign in 1970, and by the city’s 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 1981, the Beach was celebrating its own 50<sup>th</sup> birthday and 10 years of a <a href="https://www.teamunify.com/Home.jsp?team=recnslmst">Mudrats Swim Team</a>. Over the years, many improvements were made to the Beach, but some things remain the same.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Beach 85 years ago, lifeguards have gone through rigorous training, and getting a lifeguard position at the Beach is tough for even the most seasoned swimmers. Each guard must be certified in first aid, CPR and SCUBA. In addition to hard-won skill and training, the guards share a tradition that dates back to 1967 of creating graffiti “artwork” in the bathhouse to immortalize special memories of the summer.</p>
<p>There’s also the generations of “Centennial Beach Bums” who have picnicked on the Beach’s grassy expanse of lawn under its shady trees every day all summer. Centennial Beach’s closing day for the year is September 4 – don’t miss your opportunity to join those beach bums before the season is over.</p>
<p>And while Naperville will never see a surfing competition, pelican or sand dune, this unlikely beach town just might be one of the best “staycation” destinations under the sun.</p>

<p>Spring has most assuredly sprung. Budding trees dot the landscape like Impressionist paintings, bulbs reach for the nourishing sun, and butterflies alight here, then there, seeking the nectar so plentiful this time of year, especially at Monarch Landing. Residents need go no farther than their windows to see Mother Nature in all her glory.</p>
<p>But spring is for getting out, stretching the legs, the imagination, and the boundless limits of life in retirement. A good place to start is just a few miles southeast of Monarch Landing: Naperville’s “crown jewel,” the Riverwalk. A gem within a gem, you might say, as Modern Maturity and Kiplinger recently deemed Naperville one of <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/retirement/T006-S001-best-cities-for-early-retirement/index.html">America’s best places to retire</a>.</p>
<p>Along the west bank of the DuPage River, the Riverwalk teems with life of all kinds. Ducklings swirl in the eddies, geese honk to comic effect, dogs trot merrily along the paths, fish jump in the river. People come to life as well, awakening to the many things to do and see along the paths that can make for a brief, leisurely stroll, a brisk workout, or something in between.</p>
<p>Embellished with beautiful covered bridges, fountains, gardens, sculptures, statues, sanctuaries for gathering and rest, an outdoor amphitheater, a manmade beach, expansive playground, stately carillon, outdoor café, paddleboat quarry, and more, the Riverwalk is the ideal place to spend a spring afternoon, particularly with winter-weary grandchildren eager for outdoor play.</p>
<p>Were all this not enough, there is a new allure along the water, the <a href="https://waterstreetcommunity.info/">Water Street District</a>. For many years, this non-descript area at the south end of downtown Naperville seemed little more than “the end of the Riverwalk.” A fizzle after the dazzle. Today, this section of town is reborn and luminous, exuding a <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20161115/news/161119425/">“wow” factor</a> that is much more than the sum of its parts, including 2.5 acres of chic new shops and restaurants, a luxury hotel, office and banquet space, and a parking deck. For all its pomp and circumstance, the Water Street District already feels like a seasoned member of the Riverwalk “family,” with nary a growing pain in sight. Conceived ten years ago, what was formerly nothing is now<br />
something – <em>really</em> something.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement are the three-wheeled, electric <a href="https://downtownnaperville.com/all-aboard-tuk-tuks-have-arrived-in-downtown-naperville/">Tuk-Tuks</a> that have come to town, numbering three of only 65 in the U.S., shuttling people around the Water Street District and elsewhere in downtown Naperville. These little transporters with the funny name are lit up at night and lend a festive air to the streets of Naperville. Former Mayor George Pradel is said to be a frequent passenger. People can ride the <a href="https://www.napervilletrolley.com/">Naperville Trolley</a>, too, for a tour of the sights and attractions or private parties on wheels (think grandkids’ birthdays!).</p>
<p>Naperville is thriving in industry and progress, ranking year after year one of the country’s best places to live. But the downtown area holds tight to its small-town charm and rural roots, making it that much more accessible to Monarch Landing residents and their families. Spring on down!</p>
