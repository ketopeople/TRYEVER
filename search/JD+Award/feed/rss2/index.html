It’s a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201009/top-reasons-americans-are-food-obsessed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national obsession</a>.</p>
<p>We post sumptuous displays of our latest meal on social media (rather distastefully known as “food porn”). We feast our eyes on multiple food networks and TV shows that make competitive sport of meal preparation. We purchase ready-to-cook fare featuring exotic products of which we’ve never heard. We take expensive cooking classes, invite professional chefs into our homes, and inflate our grocery bills at upscale markets with offerings labeled “organic, artisanal, farm-to-fork, haute, chef-driven, locavore” and any number of <a href="https://www.houstonpress.com/restaurants/foodie-words-that-must-be-banished-now-lets-start-with-foodie-6404101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things ending in “arian</a>.”</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/save-money/dont-eat-out-as-often/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dine out more often than not</a>, eating an average of four to five meals per week. American <a href="https://www.nrn.com/sales-trends/us-restaurant-sales-reach-record-863b-2019-nra-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurant industry sales</a> hit nearly $900 billion dollars in 2019, almost a four percent increase from the year before.</p>
<p>And we’re after more than a full tummy – we want an <em>experience</em>. Some even suggest that food has not only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/opinion/sunday/how-food-replaced-art-as-high-culture.html?auth=login-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become an art</a>, it has replaced it. “Nobody cares if you know about Mozart or Leonardo anymore, but you had better be able to discuss the difference between ganache and couverture,” remarked one opinion writer in the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>Foodism and its devotees, “<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/153335/foodie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foodies</a>,” became known in niche circles of gastronomists in the 1980s. Today, it seems to apply to anyone who wants more than a plain burger and fries for dinner. While Millennials are credited with fueling the foodie culture, it was the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2017/07/20/how-generation-yum-is-stoking-the-foodie-frenzy/#3dedff84613f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boomers who first proposed</a> that people should pay attention to what they eat and how they eat it. As such, experts advise that the food industry should <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/customer-experience/why-restaurants-cant-neglect-baby-boomers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay close attention</a> to the wishes and capabilities of the Baby Boom generation.</p>
<p>Restaurants that succeed (rare in an industry in which <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/why-do-restaurants-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80 percent of them fail</a> within the first five years) know that several factors must come together to create a <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/key-elements-successful-restaurant-25545.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great culinary experience</a>. First is the food, of course. Customers require that it be delicious, fresh, at the proper temperature and requested preparation and, often, artfully presented. <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/food/more-diners-want-natural-healthy-food-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthy food options</a> are increasingly important to in-house and to-go diners as well.</p>
<p>Next is environment – décor and ambience that is commensurate with the establishment’s dining style and menu options, followed by outstanding customer service. These are all the elements of dining programs in today’s premier retirement communities as well, Monarch Landing’s included.</p>
<p>In Naperville, Chicago and other suburbs, food is being celebrated in a weeklong event called Restaurant Week. <a href="https://www.dinenaperville.com/participating-restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naperville’s Restaurant Week</a> began January 24 and goes through February 8, featuring scores of local restaurants offering either prix-fixe menus at affordable prices or discounts on certain dishes.</p>
<p>At Monarch Landing, an <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/2020/01/29/new-force-leading-dining-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exciting development</a> has whet the appetites of residents and staff at our <a href="https://welcometomonarchlanding.com/?s=JD+Award" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-rated</a> senior living community. The new culinary team of James “Jimmy” Blyther and Sean Curry, both vastly experienced in food and beverage at luxury hotels and restaurants, are whipping up some great things in our dining program. Interviewed by a committee of knowledgeable residents with perceptive palates, the two are beyond thrilled to serve as “personal chef” to everyone at Monarch Landing.</p>
<p>On top of what’s already an outstanding aspect of life at Monarch Landing, this is the icing on the cake!</p>

<p>Our management company, Life Care Services®, An LCS® Company, was ranked highest in Customer Satisfaction among Senior Living Communities in the J.D. Power study. This award demonstrates that residents and their families are receiving the care and service they absolutely deserve.</p>
<p>The award for Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Senior Living Communities encompasses seven individual resident-experience factors. We’re excited to say that, not only did Life Care Services win the overall category, but it also ranked highest within each of the seven factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resident Services and Activities</li>
<li>Community Staff</li>
<li>Food and Beverage</li>
<li>New Resident Orientation</li>
<li>Resident Cost</li>
<li>Community and Grounds</li>
<li>Resident Apartment Unit</li>
</ul>
<p>“Our company is committed to providing the resources for communities to deliver an exceptional resident experience driven by innovation, signature programs and quality services. The J.D. Power award represents the voice of the senior living customer, and I can’t think of a more important voice than that of the residents we serve,” says Joel Nelson, LCS president and CEO.</p>
<p>At Monarch Landing, we strive to bring the Life Care Services resident-first mentality into our everyday actions. In its unbiased comprehensive study, J.D. Power surveyed 3,021 residents, family members and friends of residents living in communities across the United States. Life Care services scored a full 49 index points above the next highest-performing senior living organization. We are grateful and humbled to receive this honor, especially since it comes from the people we work so hard to serve each day.</p>
<h3>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR RESIDENTS?</h3>
<p>We are deeply grateful to know that our hard work is valued, and we at Monarch Landing want to assure residents, family, friends and staff that we will continue to improve, evolve and innovate to provide the newest offerings to meet the needs of current and future residents.</p>
